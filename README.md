# Osborn-Ryder 3D Mesh Generation
Project repository for the B. Sc. thesis in Computer Science "Utilizing multibeam bathymetry data in 3D-mesh generation for finite element simulations of glacier-fjord circulation" by Victor BÃ¤cklin at the Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University.

All code used in the study, including full implementation details for mesh generation and the model Poisson simulations, is found here.
