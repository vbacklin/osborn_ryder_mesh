# Osborn-Ryder 3D Mesh Generation
Project repository for the B. Sc. thesis in Computer Science "Utilizing multibeam bathymetry data in 3D-mesh generation for finite element simulations of glacier-fjord circulation" by Victor BÃ¤cklin at the Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University.

All code used in the study, including full implementation details for mesh generation and the model Poisson simulations, is found here. 

No full instruction manual for the code exists as of now, but if you have any questions feel free to open an issue, or shoot me an email at vbacklin@gmail.com
